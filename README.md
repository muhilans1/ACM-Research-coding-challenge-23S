# Coding Challenge: Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
## By: Muhilan Selvaa 
## Introduction

The goal of this project was to learn data-visualization techniques and libraries in Python mainly using pandas and matplotlib. In order to accomplish this, I created the most obvious data-visualization when given a dataset about stars: the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. I decided to go with the theoretical rather than the observational H-R diagram which plots luminosity against temperature.
